Thiswork builds on recent ideas of Volker Strassen, by using a basic trilinear form which is not a matrix product. We make novel use of the Salem-Spencer Theorem, which gives a fairly dense set of integers with no three-term arithmetic progression. Our resulting matrix exponent is 2.376."

abstract = {It is shown in this paper that the iterative algorithm introduced by Berlekamp for decoding BCH codes actually provides a general solution to the problem of synthesizing the shortest linear feedback shift register capable of generating a prescribed finite sequence of digits. The shift-register approach leads to a simple proof of the validity of the algorithm as well as providing additional insight into its properties. The equivalence of the decoding problem for BCH codes to a shift-register synthesis problem is demonstrated, and other applications for the algorithm are suggested. {\textcopyright} 1969, IEEE.

@article{Hu2012,
abstract = {As a hardware-oriented stream cipher, Trivium is on the edge of low cost and compactness. In this paper we discuss how brittle Trivium is under fault attack. Our fault model is based on the following two assumptions: (1)We can make fault injection on the state at a random time and (2) after each fault injection, the fault positions are from random one of three registers, and from a random area within eight neighboring bits. Our fault model has extremely weak assumptions for effective attack , and much weaker than that of Hojs{\'{i}}k and Rudolf, in their fault attack on Trivium.We present a checkingmethod such that, by observing original key-stream segment and fault injected key-stream segment, the injecting time and fault positions can be determined. Then, for several distributions of the injecting time, our random simulations always show that the attacker can break Trivium by a small number of repeated fault injections. For example, suppose that the injecting time has an uniform distribution over {\{}0, 1, ⋯ , 32{\}}, then averagely no more than 16 repeated fault injection procedures will break Trivium, by averagely observing no more than 195 × 17 key-stream bits. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.},

@article{Swierczynski2015,
abstract = {This paper investigates a novel attack vector against cryptography realized on FPGAs, which poses a serious threat to real-world applications. We demonstrate how a targeted bitstream modification can seriously weaken cryptographic algorithms, which we show with the examples of AES and 3-DES. The attack is performed by modifying the FPGA bitstream that configures the hardware elements during initialization. Recently, it has been shown that cloning of FPGA designs is feasible, even if the bitstream is encrypted. However, due to its proprietary file format, a meaningful modification is challenging. While some previous work addressed bitstream reverse-engineering, so far it has not been evaluated how difficult it is to detect and modify cryptographic elements. We outline two possible practical attacks that have serious security implications. We target the S-boxes of block ciphers that can be implemented in look-up tables or stored as precomputed set of values in the memory of the FPGA. We demonstrate that it is possible to detect and apply meaningful changes to cryptographic elements inside an unknown, proprietary, and undocumented bitstream. Our proposed attack does not require any knowledge of the internal routing. Furthermore, we show how an AES key can be revealed within seconds. Finally, we discuss countermeasures that can raise the bar for an adversary to successfully perform this kind of attack.},

abstract="In this paper we present experimental results of an application of SAT solvers in current cryptography. Trivium is a very promising stream cipher candidate in the final phase of the eSTREAM project. We use the fastest industrial SAT solvers to attack a reduced version of Trivium -- called Bivium. Our experimental attack time using the SAT solver is the best attack time that we are aware of, it is faster than the following attacks: exhaustive search, a BDD based attack, a graph theoretic approach and an attack based on Gr{\"o}bner bases. The attack recovers the internal state of the cipher by first setting up an equation system describing the internal state, then transforming it into CNF and then solving it. When one implements this attack, several questions have to be answered and several parameters have to be optimised.",

abstract="We describe a new class of attacks on secure microcontrollers and smartcards. Illumination of a target transistor causes it to conduct, thereby inducing a transient fault. Such attacks are practical; they do not even require expensive laser equipment. We have carried them out using a flashgun bought second-hand from a camera store for {\$}30 and with an {\$}8 laser pointer. As an illustration of the power of this attack, we developed techniques to set or reset any individual bit of SRAM in a microcontroller. Unless suitable countermeasures are taken, optical probing may also be used to induce errors in cryptographic computations or protocols, and to disrupt the processor's control flow. It thus provides a powerful extension of existing glitching and fault analysis techniques. This vulnerability may pose a big problem for the industry, similar to those resulting from probing attacks in the mid-1990s and power analysis attacks in the late 1990s.",
