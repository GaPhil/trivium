\section{Introduction}




In this paper we analyse the design choices made by the authors of Trivium, in order to discover a new class of vulnerabilities. 


We go on to demonstrate a fault attack on the software implementation of Trivium.

\section{Background}

As a result of the failures of all six stream ciphers submitted to the NESSIE (New European Schemes for Signatures, Integrity and Encryption) project, in 2004 the eSTREAM project was launched in order to \textit{"identify new stream ciphers suitable for widespread adoption"}\cite{call}.



\section{Ease of Use}

\subsection{Code Analysis}
The official C code authored by Christophe De Canni\`ere can be found on  

In the C code the \code{UPDATE()} macro originally does the following
\begin{lstlisting}[style=snippet]
#define UPDATE()
do { 
T(1) = S64(1, 66) ^ S64(1, 93);
T(2) = S64(2, 69) ^ S64(2, 84);
T(3) = S64(3, 66) ^ S96(3, 111);

Z(T(1) ^ T(2) ^ T(3));

T(1) ^= (S64(1, 91) & S64(1, 92)) ^ S64(2, 78); 
T(2) ^= (S64(2, 82) & S64(2, 83)) ^ S64(3, 87); 
T(3) ^= (S96(3, 109) & S96(3, 110)) ^ S64(1, 69); 
} while (0)
\end{lstlisting}
However, our fault injection is done as follows in the C code.
\begin{lstlisting}[style=snippet]
#define UPDATE()
do {
.       .       .
.       .       .
.       .       .
T(1) ^= S64(1, 91) ^ S64(2, 78); 
T(2) ^= S64(2, 82) ^ S64(3, 87); 
T(3) ^= S96(3, 109) ^ S64(1, 69); 
} while (0)
\end{lstlisting}

The \code{UPDATE()} macro is used in the \code{ECRYPT\_ivsetup} and \code{ECRYPT\_process\_bytes} functions. This means that when disassembling the \code{trivium.o} object file 

We run the fault injected code using the following key \code{0x0F62B5085BAE0154A7FA} and IV \code{0x288FF65DC42B92F960C7}. Using the Berlekamp–Massey algorithm \cite{massey} we find the shortest linear feedback register (LFSR) for the given bitstream. The polynomial is
$x^{61} + x^{60} + x^{55} + x^{54} + x^{52} + x^{51} + x^{46} + x^{45} + x^{43} + x^{42} + x^{41} + x^{40} + x^{39} + x^{38} + x^{37} + x^{36} + x^{35} + x^{31} + x^{28} + x^{25} + x^{24} + x^{23} + x^{20} + x^{19} + x^{18} + x^{11} + x^8 + x^7 + 1$.

\subsection{Unwinding the bitstream}



Number equations consecutively. To make your
equations more compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or
appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables,
but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus
sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a
sentence, as in:
\begin{equation}
a+b=\gamma\label{eq}
\end{equation}

Be sure that the
symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following
the equation. Use ``\eqref{eq}'', not ``Eq.~\eqref{eq}'' or ``equation \eqref{eq}'', except at
the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation \eqref{eq} is . . .''

\subsection{\LaTeX-Specific Advice}

Please use ``soft'' (e.g., \verb|\eqref{Eq}|) cross references instead
of ``hard'' references (e.g., \verb|(1)|). That will make it possible
to combine sections, add equations, or change the order of figures or
citations without having to go through the file line by line.

Please don't use the \verb|{eqnarray}| equation environment. Use
\verb|{align}| or \verb|{IEEEeqnarray}| instead. The \verb|{eqnarray}|
environment leaves unsightly spaces around relation symbols.

Please note that the \verb|{subequations}| environment in {\LaTeX}
will increment the main equation counter even when there are no
equation numbers displayed. If you forget that, you might write an
article in which the equation numbers skip from (17) to (20), causing
the copy editors to wonder if you've discovered a new method of
counting.

{\BibTeX} does not work by magic. It doesn't get the bibliographic
data from thin air but from .bib files. If you use {\BibTeX} to produce a
bibliography you must send the .bib files.

{\LaTeX} can't read your mind. If you assign the same label to a
subsubsection and a table, you might find that Table I has been cross
referenced as Table IV-B3.

{\LaTeX} does not have precognitive abilities. If you put a
\verb|\label| command before the command that updates the counter it's
supposed to be using, the label will pick up the last counter to be
cross referenced instead. In particular, a \verb|\label| command
should not go before the caption of a figure or a table.

Do not use \verb|\nonumber| inside the \verb|{array}| environment. It
will not stop equation numbers inside \verb|{array}| (there won't be
any anyway) and it might stop a wanted equation number in the
surrounding equation.

\subsection{Some Common Mistakes}\label{SCM}
\begin{itemize}
\item The word ``data'' is plural, not singular.
\item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum $\mu_{0}$, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ``o''.
\item In American English, commas, semicolons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
\item A graph within a graph is an ``inset'', not an ``insert''. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates).
\item Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or ``effectively''.
\item In your paper title, if the words ``that uses'' can accurately replace the word ``using'', capitalize the ``u''; if not, keep using lower-cased.
\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' and ``effect'', ``complement'' and ``compliment'', ``discreet'' and ``discrete'', ``principal'' and ``principle''.
\item Do not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer''.
\item The prefix ``non'' is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
\item There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin abbreviation ``et al.''.
\item The abbreviation ``i.e.'' means ``that is'', and the abbreviation ``e.g.'' means ``for example''.
\end{itemize}
An excellent style manual for science writers is \cite{b7}.

\subsection{Authors and Affiliations}
\textbf{The class file is designed for, but not limited to, six authors.} A
minimum of one author is required for all conference articles. Author names
should be listed starting from left to right and then moving down to the
next line. This is the author sequence that will be used in future citations
and by indexing services. Names should not be listed in columns nor group by
affiliation. Please keep your affiliations as succinct as possible (for
example, do not differentiate among departments of the same organization).

\subsection{Figures and Tables}
\paragraph{Positioning Figures and Tables} Place figures and tables at the top and
bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large
figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be
below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert
figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation
``Fig.~\ref{fig}'', even at the beginning of a sentence.

\begin{table}[htbp]

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words
rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to
avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity
``Magnetization'', or ``Magnetization, M'', not just ``M''. If including
units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only
with units. In the example, write ``Magnetization (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization
\{A[m(1)]\}'', not just ``A/m''. Do not label axes with a ratio of
quantities and units. For example, write ``Temperature (K)'', not
``Temperature/K''.

\section*{Acknowledgment}

The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without
an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B.
G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor
acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.
